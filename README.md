HOW TO WORK WITH THE BOILER PLATE 

This app uses webpack to bundle code and it is very important that you write your code in the appropriate folder so that the bundler can find the file and serve it.

The only place you need to work on is in the src folder. There you have 
1. views folder which will contain your html files
2. Styles folder which will contain scss folder
3. Media folder which will contain pictures
4. js folder which will contain javascript code

Any new scss file for styling that that you create has to be declared in the entry.scss file. The file is located inside the views folder and is the scss entry point for webpack. For example, if you create a nav.scss file, you can declare it like this

            @import './nav.scss';

IF YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH SCSS , YOU CAN USE CSS. THEY WORK THE SAME WAY
